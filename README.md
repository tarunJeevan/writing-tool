# writing-tool

*A web application created and developed primarily over the course of a graduate web development class.*

It was inspired by other writing and worldbuilding tools such as [Campfire](https://www.campfirewriting.com/write) and [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/author). 

Like its inspirations, writing-tool has a number of features *(most of them still in development)* designed to help authors organize documents, track characters, build maps, create timelines, record world histories, and more. 

## Features
***The following is a list of features both complete and in-development:***

### Character Creator (In-Development)
- Design detailed characters by choosing avatars, creating profiles, writing description posts, and more. 

### Relationship Map (In-Development)
- Map every relationship between all your created characters with labels and short descriptions.

### Timelines (In-Development)
- Create timelines for anything in your fictional universe: events, relationships, geopolitics, and more.

### Map Creator (In-Development)
- Upload a map image or create one from scratch, then mark locations with pins that indicate where certain events in your universe happen.

### Manuscript Editor (In-Development)
- Create, save, and delete any number of manuscripts.
