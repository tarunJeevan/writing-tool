# writing-tool

## About
*A web application created and developed primarily over the course of a graduate web development class.*

It was inspired by other writing and worldbuilding tools such as [Campfire](https://www.campfirewriting.com/write) and [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/author). 

Like its inspirations, writing-tool has a number of features *(most of them still in development)* designed to help authors organize documents, track characters, build maps, create timelines, record world histories, and more.
